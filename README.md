# vim-vimfiler-gitstatus
This is a vim plugin to add a gitstatus column to [vimfiler](https://github.com/Shougo/vimfiler.vim)   
It uses the gitstatus column code from [Spacevim](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim) Specifically [this](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim/blob/dev/autoload/vimfiler/columns/gitstatus.vim) file.  
I have set it up as a plugin added to my [custom-config](https://github.com/jderr-mx/custom-configs) dotfiles repo which I am using with
[JarrodCTaylor's](https://github.com/JarrodCTaylor/dotfiles) excellent collection of dotfiles. 

__I in no way take any credit for this work, this is the work of the [Spacevim](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim) team__
